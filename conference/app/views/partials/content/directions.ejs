<p><strong>Jeonju University</strong> is located at the west end of Jeonju. From the bus terminal, it will take approximately 15 minutes by taxi (probably a little more than 5,000 won) to arrive there. <strong>Star Center</strong> is located right in the center the university, and is the largest building on campus. It sits just in front of the large clock tower building (pictured above), and has tennis courts below it.</p>

<p>The conference will take place on the <strong>3rd floor</strong> of Star Center. You may enter through either the <strong>Onnuri Hall</strong> auditorium entrance (in front of the clock tower), or the <strong>Food Court</strong> entrance (one level higher, near the fountain).</p>

<p>The tallest building in the picture above is the <strong>Star Tower</strong> student dormitory building. It is located over the <strong>Old Gate</strong> entrance road. The <strong>New Gate</strong> entrance road is located to the left of the picture between the green golf netting and cluster of white Engineering buildings there.</p>

    <h4>Hanok Village</h4>
    <p>Jeonju is home to the largest Hanok Village in Korea. With over 800 Hanok houses, it's become Jeonju's largest tourist draw. If you want an "authentic" Korean experience, we highly recommend staying in one of the dozens of Hanok hotels available.</p>

    <p>Below are some recommended Hanok stays.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.xn--3v0br0my7mla69px00b.com/">Laon Hanok Guest House</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/kr/my-stay.en-gb.html">My Stay</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Shinsikaji</h4>
    <img src="/img/location/nightlife.jpg">
    <br>
    <p>There are also numerous hotels and motels available closer to Jeonju's nightlife in Shinsikaji, which is located just a short distance from the University in Hyoja Dong. You can usually walk in and book a room on the spot for around 40,000 per night (but it depends on availability).</p>

    <p>Please let us know at the Conference if you need any help booking a room.</p>

    <p>Or, should you run into any difficulty finding your way, please contact our chapter's president, Ingrid, at</p>
